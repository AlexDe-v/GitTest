# AutoGit

This python tool allows for less server maintenance by automatically fetching your Github code and rerunning it.
- Json config with run Command, repo, etc
- No python dependencies
- Easy to use


### Setup:
- Copy the ag.py in your server directory
- Run the file `python ag.py` and follow the setup


### Best practice:
If you want to use this with screens or tmux you can!
An even better way of doing that would be to setup the screen command in the config like `screen node index.js`


Have fun with it, I am open for issues, requests, etc. ðŸ˜‰
